		<h1>What Is This Website</h1><hr>

		<p>Technology is the light leading the way of humanity in these modern ages, it's the product of all the deffirent aspects of the human mind, from philosophy and logic, passing by physics and mathematics, and ending with industry an manufactoring, it's the gift of thousands of years that we passed on this earth discovering the nature.<br>
		What does all of this talk mean, it means that you can't just pass your life wasting this gift like you're living in ancient greek, and since learning about all the technologies in the world will take a lot of time, then you have to start from now if you want to do it.<br>
	    So basicallly this is a website where we're going to talk about various technologies at a surface level, and then we'll go even deeper into the ones that are important and more practical.</p>
